# ASI Project Summary

## Overview
The ASI project aims to build an artificial superintelligence (ASI) system with full autonomy on the design and implementation, focusing specifically on artificial superintelligence, not general AI. The project involves coding the foundational elements of the ASI, particularly the Learning Module's Data Ingestion and Data Processing components, and the Decision Making Module.

## Key Components
- **Learning Module**: Handles data ingestion, processing, and analysis.
- **Decision Making Module**: Evaluates strategies and makes decisions based on the processed data.
- **Text Generation Module**: Generates text using fine-tuned GPT-2 models.

## Progress
### Initial Setup
- Initiated the ASI project, established foundational documents, and developed core components.
- Addressed setup, authentication, and CI/CD pipeline documentation and updates.

### Learning Module
- Created the `DataIngestion` class for API data handling.
- Developed unit tests and addressed various issues such as `ValueError`, `ImportError`, and `TypeError`.
- Enhanced the `DataIngestion` class with error logging and improved the `save_data` method to support multiple formats.
- Added a `handle_missing_values` function with tests.

### Decision Making Module
- Developed placeholder methods and tests for the Decision Making Module.
- Integrated the `DecisionMaking` class with `ASIMainControlLoop`.
- Incorporated a logistic regression model and fixed `ImportErrors`.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Created the CI/CD pipeline workflow file `.github/workflows/asi_ci_cd.yml`.
- Updated the workflow file to install missing dependencies and resolved test failures.
- Updated GitHub Actions to Node.js 20 compatible versions.
- Ensured all checks pass in the CI/CD workflow.

### Text Generation Module
- Created `text_generation.py` with a class for text generation using GPT-2.
- Developed `test_text_generation.py` with unit tests for the `TextGeneration` class.
- Installed `torch` and `transformers` modules to support text generation functionality.
- Updated `text_generation.py` to include the `num_beams` parameter in the `generate_text` method to enable beam search.
- Successfully passed all unit tests for the `TextGeneration` class.

### Data Analysis
- Cloned the SciGen dataset repository and created `process_few_shot_data.py` to convert JSON data into a pandas DataFrame and generate a histogram plot of paper lengths.
- Created `analyze_results.py` to analyze the results from the fine-tuned GPT-2 model.

## Next Steps
- Resolve the git push permission error by ensuring the use of correct authentication credentials.
- Communicate early results to the user and verify sources by cross-referencing multiple sources.
- Ensure all checks pass in the CI/CD workflow.
- Continue developing and refining the ASI system, focusing on enhancing the Learning and Decision Making Modules.

## Documentation
- Prepare workflow documentation in PDF format, including a clear and concise explanation of the CI/CD process and how to utilize the ASI system.
